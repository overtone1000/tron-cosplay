# Summary

This is a full-scale replica of an identity disk from TRON Legacy. It can be made to light up using LED strips and a 9v battery. Careful assembly is required.

For printing purposes the file prefix indicates filament to use: "BLK" is black, "TRN" is transparent. The black parts need support; the transparent parts don't.

The file suffix indicates how many: "_8" means print 8, "_2" means print 2, "_4M" means print 2 normally and 2 more in mirror image.

update july 2016: I've uploaded a seamless version of the disc for users with larger printers.

# Post-Printing

## Gluing and Painting

Glue 4 disk pieces to make the top and 4 more to make the bottom. Fill the cracks with putty and sand to hide the join lines and deposition texture. Paint it black. You may also want to mask the stripes and paint them a different black.

Once the black disk halves are painted glue in the transparent parts. The strips and ends fit into the C slot and the blade parts fit around the edge of one of the halves. The strips don't completely fill the C slot, so I used an additional piece and cut it to fill the gap.

## Wiring and Assembly

From http://glowhut.com/ get two segments of 335 LED strip with 9v connectors: one 20 inches and the other 24 inches. Splice them both into the same power supply with an 8mm push-to-toggle DIP switch to turn them on and off. Place them into the inner and outer light loops. There are holes for two switches (for inner and outer lights) but I just used one. Also I've included the plugs for the holes but they may not be necessary either.

Once the wiring is in place final assembly consists of screwing the two halves together. Using screws allows the battery to be replaced.

## Mounting

The disc is designed to be mounted on a backpack unit found at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1083616. 8 rare-earth magnets are used to attach it securely to the backpack and be released with a gentle tug.
